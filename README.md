# PF2e Level Up Wizard

A module for PF2e on FoundryVTT that provides a level up assistant for players.

## Installation

This module is not accessible in the module directory within FoundryVTT yet, but can be installed via this manifest link: `https://github.com/BenABaron/pf2e-level-up-wizard/releases/latest/download/module.json`

## Usage

Once the module is enabled, players will see a wizard hat appear on their character sheets next to their level. This can be moved to the window's toolbar in the settings.
When it's time to level up, simply click the wizard hat to start up the Level Up Wizard.

Currently the wizard only handles Feats and Skill Increases, but I plan on adding in more features in the future (see `Future` section below)
Follow the steps on screen, hit submit (and confirm!), and watch as the wizard handles all of the necessary changes to the character sheet!
