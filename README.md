# PF2e Level Up Wizard

A module for PF2e on FoundryVTT that provides a level up assistant for players.

## Installation

Install using the `Install Module` browser in Foundry.

## Usage

Once the module is enabled, players will see a wizard hat appear on their character sheets next to their level. This can be moved to the window's toolbar in the settings.
When it's time to level up, simply click the wizard hat to start up the Level Up Wizard.

Follow the steps on screen, hit submit (and confirm!), and watch as the wizard handles all of the necessary changes to the character sheet!
